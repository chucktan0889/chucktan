        <h1>WHAT IS PLAYCON</h1>
        <P>PLAYCON is a gaming community and creative collective formed from the 
            love of playing video games with friends. What started as a 
            community with the goal of creating content about video games has 
            evolved and grown into facebook gaming platform.
            PLAYCON is created by Chuck Fernandez
            in the Philippines, and regularly updates games, manages pages, and creates content that anyone who loves gaming can enjoy. <br/>

            impact through gaming. We continuously aim to be a good influence in the overall gaming community,
             with a battlecry that urges our community to PLAY AND LEARN!
